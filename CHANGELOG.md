# changelog

All notable changes to **Suckling** will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).


## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-15

### Changed

- Startup update announcement now includes a link to the public changelog page.

---

## [1.6.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- Startup update announcement: when the bot launches on a newly shipped version, it posts an embed to the configured update channel and records the announced version in sqlite so normal restarts do not repost it.

---

## [1.5.1] — 2026-05-15

### Changed
- TMDB client hardened: `tmdb._get` now handles retry/backoff (429 with `Retry-After` honored, 5xx with exponential backoff, transient network errors retried twice), enforces a global concurrency semaphore (8 simultaneous requests), and de-dupes in-flight requests so simultaneous calls for the same movie share one network round-trip. TTL caching centralized in `_get` — per-function cache logic removed from `get_movie_details`, `get_movie_cast`, `get_watch_providers`, `get_movie_keywords`, and `get_movie_images`.
- TMDB connection pool tuned: explicit `limit=32`, `limit_per_host=8`, DNS cache (5 min), `enable_cleanup_closed=True`. Timeout split into `sock_connect=10s` and `sock_read=20s`.
- `picker._fetch_pool` and `tracker._discover_horror_movies` now fetch pages in batches of 8 concurrently instead of one-at-a-time with sleeps. Cold-cache refresh in picker drops from ~10s+ of sleeps to ~2-3s.
- `tracker.run_check` runs 8 provider lookups concurrently per batch instead of sequentially. DB reads/writes still serialized per movie within the batch. Tracker no longer sleeps between movies — the global TMDB semaphore provides backpressure.
- Plex library cache hardened: refresh lock prevents concurrent commands from kicking off duplicate library scans. Added a precomputed normalized-title index, making `find_movie_by_title` an O(1) dict lookup instead of an O(n) scan-and-normalize. Precomputed dict version of the library so stats/random commands don't rebuild dicts every call.
- Plex library warms in the background at bot startup via a new `plex.warm_cache()` so the first `/rb9` or `/rent` after a restart doesn't pay the full library scan cost. Errors are logged but never block startup.
- New `tmdb.discover_movies()` helper. `picker.py` and `tracker.py` no longer reach into `tmdb.get_session()` or craft raw aiohttp calls — they go through the helper and inherit the new semaphore/retry/dedup automatically. Removed now-unused `config` import from `picker.py` and `tracker.py`.

### Notes
- TMDB cache key format changed (from per-function prefixes like `details:{id}` to path+params like `tmdb:/movie/{id}?...`). Cache is in-memory only, so this only matters at deploy: the cache starts cold.
- Watch providers TTL dropped from 6h to 30min. The tracker still passes `force=True` so its behavior is unchanged, but `/suck`, `/roll`, and the daily rec may refresh providers more often.
- No behavior changes to any user-facing command. No database migrations.
- One minor batching delta in picker/tracker discover pulls: when an empty page appears mid-batch, the loop now finishes the current batch before stopping instead of stopping immediately. TMDB doesn't have "holes" in discover results so this is academic.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-15

### Added

**video store rental system** — users can "rent" a film from the RB9 Plex library, have 48 hours to watch it, and return it with a review. reviews post to a configurable Discord forum channel.

- `/rent` — picks a random film from the library (excluding anything the user has rented before). shows an offer screen with up to 2 re-rolls: first pick shows "re-roll", second shows "re-roll (last one)" with a warning, third pick is auto-confirmed with no choice. flow is fully ephemeral.
- `/return rating recommend [thoughts]` — returns the active rental and posts a review to the forum. rating is 1-10, recommend is a boolean toggle, thoughts are optional. edits the forum thread in-place: updates the starter message, renames the thread from "checked out" to "reviewed", and adds the recommendation tag if applicable.
- `/myrental` — ephemeral status card for your current rental: film, when you checked it out, when it's due (as a Discord timestamp), and a link to the forum thread.
- `/latefees` — leaderboard of accumulated late fees sorted descending. $1/day for every day overdue (computed at return time).
- `/rentalstats [user]` — rental history and stats for yourself or any member: total rentals, on-time vs late count, total fees paid, currently renting (if applicable), and last 5 returns.
- `/setreviews <forum_channel>` — admin-only. configures the forum channel for rental posts and auto-detects "rental" and "recommendation" forum tags. warns if either tag is missing.
- `/cancelrental @user [reason]` — admin-only. cancels a user's active rental with no late fee, edits the forum thread to show a grey cancelled state, and DMs the user with the reason.
- **rent button** on existing embeds — `/rb9`, `/rb9randomscene`, `/suck` (if in library), `/roll` (if in library), and daily rec (if in library) all show a 📼 `confirm rental` / `nevermind` button when the film is available in the Plex library. button-initiated rentals get 0 re-rolls since the user already chose a specific film.
- **DM reminders** — bot DMs users when they have less than 12 hours left on a rental (once), and again when they go overdue (once).
- `rental.py` — new module handling forum thread creation/editing, late fee calculation, overdue notification, and reminder DMs. takes `bot` as a parameter; does not import `bot.py`.
- `rentals` table in `data/moviebot.db` — stores rental records with full lifecycle state (active, returned, cancelled), plex key snapshot, thread/message IDs, rating, thoughts, late fee, and notification flags.
- three new config keys in the `config` table: `reviews_channel_id`, `rental_tag_id`, `recommendation_tag_id`.
- hourly APScheduler job (`rental_check`) running `check_overdue` and `check_reminders`.
- `rating_key` field added to `plex._movie_to_dict` — needed to uniquely identify films across rerolls and for all-time exclusion tracking.
- `plex.pick_random_for_rental(exclude_keys)` — picks a random film excluding a given set of plex rating keys.

### Notes

- one active rental per user at a time. must `/return` before renting again.
- past rentals (any status) are permanently excluded from future `/rent` random picks for that user.
- forum thread lifecycle: created on rental confirmation with a "checked out" embed, edited in-place on return or admin cancel. starter message ID = thread ID in Discord forums.
- late fee is computed lazily at `/return` time: `ceil((returned_at − due_at) / 1 day) × $1`. returning on time = $0.
- no DB migration needed — `init_db` uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`. new `rating_key` field in `_movie_to_dict` is transparent to existing callers.
- forum tags must be created manually in Discord's forum settings before `/setreviews` can auto-detect them. tags expected: **rental** and **recommendation** (or "recommended").
- bot needs `create public threads` + `send messages in threads` permissions in the forum channel.
- view timeouts are 300 seconds for `/rent` flow, 120 seconds for embed rent buttons. timed-out flows create no rental (the clock only starts on confirmation).

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `/info` command — public about card showing bot version, uptime, server count, and the Suckling wordmark banner. Quick "what is this thing" reference for new server members.
- `assets/logo.png` — the Suckling wordmark, attached and referenced via `attachment://logo.png` in the embed. Rendered as `set_image` (full-width banner) rather than thumbnail since the wordmark is wide (~4.3:1).
- `SucklingBot.__init__` now stores `started_at`, used to compute uptime for `/info`.
- `info_embed()` and `_format_uptime()` helpers in `embeds.py`.

### Notes
- Uptime resets on every restart (no persistence — hobby scale).

---

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `/play` — trivia roulette game. Bot randomly picks a category (quote, emoji, tagline, or trivia) and posts a clue. First correct guess in chat wins. 30-second rounds, 1 point per win.
- `trivia_roulette.py` module with round state, JSON asset loading, and fuzzy answer matching
- `assets/` folder containing curated content per category (`quotes.json`, `emoji.json`, `taglines.json`, `trivia.json`)
- `trivia_prompt_embed` and `trivia_reveal_embed` builders in `embeds.py`

### Changed
- `/play` writes to the shared `guess_scores` table, the existing `/leaderboard` command now reflects wins from both `/guess` and `/play`
- `/giveup` extended to also end active `/play` rounds
- `/guess` and `/six` now refuse to start if a `/play` round is active in the channel (and vice versa)

### Notes
- Category content lives in `assets/*.json` and is loaded once at startup. Missing or malformed files log a warning and are skipped; the bot keeps running with whatever categories are populated. If no categories load, `/play` refuses with a friendly message.
- Each category has its own embed color and emoji badge so the "roulette" reveal feels distinct.
- No no-repeat tracking yet. With 70+ entries per category, immediate repeats are rare. Easy to add later if it becomes annoying.

## [1.2.4] — 2026-05-11

### Changed
- Renamed `/watch` to `/suck` (lol)

---

## [1.2.3] — 2026-05-10

### Changed
- TMDB calls now reuse a single shared `aiohttp.ClientSession` instead of opening a new one per request. Improves connection pooling, DNS caching, and keepalive — biggest impact on `/checknow` and the daily streaming scan, which previously opened hundreds of sessions per run. `picker._fetch_pool` and `imageops.download_image` also use the shared session.
- Internal: `tmdb._get` no longer takes a `session` parameter. Callers in `picker.py`, `tracker.py`, and `imageops.py` updated accordingly.
- Replaced deprecated `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` throughout. Forward-compatible with Python 3.12+ (which warns on `utcnow`). Stored ISO timestamps now include a `+00:00` suffix; reads via `datetime.fromisoformat` handle both old and new formats.

### Fixed
- `/roll` with a runtime filter would silently return a film that violated the filter when no candidates matched (e.g. `runtime:short` could hand back a 3-hour movie). Now caps the search at 30 candidates and returns "couldn't find anything matching those filters" honestly when nothing matches.

### Notes
- No database migration needed. Existing rows with naive ISO timestamps continue to read correctly.
- Bot subclass `SucklingBot` now closes the shared TMDB session on shutdown to avoid "Unclosed client session" warnings.

---

## [1.2.2] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- `/watch` now indicates whether the film is in the Return by 9 plex library
- When a film isn't in the library, the embed includes a small "request it" link that deep-links to the seerr instance for that film

### Notes
- Plex check is graceful: if `PLEX_TOKEN` isn't configured or the lookup fails, the rb9 line is omitted rather than risk a false "not in the library"
- Title matching strips articles, punctuation, and case. Prefers a title+year match before falling back to title-only

---

## [1.2.1] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- `/rb9genre` now counts each film once by its primary (first) genre tag instead of incrementing all genre tags. Counts now sum to the total film count, giving a cleaner "primary genre" breakdown.

---

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- `/rb9stats` — overall library stats (count, runtime, year range, ratings)
- `/rb9biggest` and `/rb9shortest` — longest/shortest films by runtime
- `/rb9oldest` and `/rb9newest` — oldest film by year, newest by date added
- `/rb9totalruntime` — fun "how long would it take to watch everything" stats
- `/rb9decade` — bar chart of films per decade
- `/rb9genre` — top 10 genres by count
- `/rb9randomscene` — random film + backdrop image

### Changed
- Renamed `/plex` to `/rb9` for consistency with the new stats commands

---

## [1.1.1] — 2026-05-03

### Changed
- `/giveup` now works for both `/guess` and `/six` rounds (previously only `/guess`)
- Bumped Six Degrees round duration from 3 to 4 minutes

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- `/six` command — Six Degrees of Separation game with two random popular actors
- `/sixleaderboard` command for the new game's separate leaderboard
- TMDB helpers: `search_person`, `get_movie_cast`, `get_popular_people`
- `six_scores` database table
- `sixdegrees.py` module with chain parsing, validation, and round state

### Notes
- Chains are validated against TMDB cast data — players submit `Actor -> Film -> Actor -> ...` chains in chat
- First valid chain wins; scoring is 5/4/3/2/1 by chain length (shorter = more points)
- Max 6 films per chain to keep validation cost reasonable

---

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-03

First shipped version. The bot is fully featured and announced to the community.

### Added
- `/guess` difficulty rework: easy (full still, 1 point) and hard (cropped poster, 2 points)
- `/version` command and startup version log line
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `version.py` for tracking releases

### Changed
- Streaming announcements now only fire for first-time digital releases. Films that move between services or get added to additional ones no longer trigger announcements.

---

## [0.9.0] — Pre-release: announcement filtering & Plex

### Added
- `announced_movies` table to track films that have ever been announced as streaming
- First-announce-aware run logic: existing streaming films get silently baselined on first run after the update
- `/plex` command — random pick from the configured Plex library, using plex.tv relay for remote access
- `PLEX_TOKEN` and `PLEX_LIBRARY` environment variables (both optional)

### Changed
- `_check_movie_providers` now returns whether a movie is currently streaming, used for baselining

---

## [0.8.0] — Pre-release: toggles and quality-of-life

### Added
- `/toggle` command for enabling/disabling streaming announcements and daily recommendations
- Lightweight error logging to `data/bot.log` with auto-rotation (1 MB cap, 3 backups)
- Try/except wrappers around scheduled jobs and `on_message` for crash visibility

---

## [0.7.0] — Pre-release: more guessing modes

### Added
- Movie still guessing — `/guess type:still` pulls a random backdrop instead of cropping a poster
- Combined `/guess` command with optional `type` and `difficulty` overrides; defaults to random for both
- TMDB `get_movie_images` and `pick_backdrop_url` helpers
- `make_still_puzzle` in `imageops.py` with mode-appropriate difficulty mapping

### Changed
- Guess rounds dynamically pick poster vs still, with a fallback to poster if no clean backdrop is available

---

## [0.6.0] — Pre-release: poster guessing game

### Added
- `/guess`, `/giveup`, `/leaderboard` commands
- Poster cropping/blurring via Pillow with three difficulty levels
- `game.py` for in-memory round state with channel-scoped active rounds

### Changed
- `on_message` listener wired up to detect correct guesses in active rounds

---

## [0.5.0] — Pre-release: random picks and daily recommendations

### Added
- `/roll` command for random horror picks with optional decade and runtime filters
- Daily horror recommendation scheduled at noon, posting to a configurable channel
- `/setdaily` admin command for configuring the daily-rec channel
- `/dailynow` admin command for manual triggering
- `picker.py` with cached candidate pool of ~1000 popular horror films
- `daily_recs` table with 30-day no-repeat exclusion logic

### Changed
- Apscheduler now runs two jobs: 9 AM streaming check + 12 PM daily recommendation

---

## [0.4.0] — Pre-release: tracking and announcements

### Added
- `/track`, `/untrack`, `/tracked` commands for the community watchlist

- `/checknow` (dry-run) and `/checknowlive` (live) admin commands
- Daily 9 AM streaming-availability scan via apscheduler
- `tracker.py` with first-run baselining and structured `CheckResult` summaries
- Auto-availability check on `/track`: if the film is already streaming, the bot says so immediately and links to where; otherwise it confirms tracking
- Provider snapshot recording on `/track` to prevent the daily job from re-announcing already-streaming films
- TMDB watch-providers caching and selective bypass with `force=True`
- In-memory cache layer (`cache.py`) with 6-hour TTL
- `/cachestats` admin command

---

## [0.3.0] — Pre-release: persistence

### Added
